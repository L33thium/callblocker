# callblocker
block unwanted calls with usb voice modem and Raspberry Pi or other Linux machine.

- run as user
- all required files ine home folder
- catch calls when vcid is transmitted
- write communications with modem in chat.log and history of calls in call.log
- read numbers in block.list
- do nothing if number not in blacklist or answer before phone rings as a fax to make callbots mark our number as fax line and do not retry.


It's just work for now, but need to correct some code before do the next step : block from regular expressions, voicemail, etc...
